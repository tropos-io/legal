## 10. Miscellaneous

### 10.1 Entire Agreement  
This Agreement (including its Clauses, Annexes, Schedules, and all Statements of Work entered into hereunder) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties in relation to its subject matter and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous proposals, discussions, agreements, understandings, or representations—whether oral or written, express or implied—pertaining to such subject matter.

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that:  
(a) it has not relied on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, warranty, or undertaking not expressly set out in this Agreement; and  
(b) nothing in this Clause shall exclude or limit liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

### 10.2 No Waiver  
No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver of that right or remedy. Any waiver must be in writing and shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.

### 10.3 Injunctive and Equitable Relief  
Each Party acknowledges that any unauthorised disclosure or use of the other Party’s Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be an insufficient remedy. Accordingly, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific performance, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.

### 10.4 Counterparts and Electronic Execution  
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

### 10.5 No Obligation to Enter Agreement  
Notwithstanding any discussions, exchanges of information, or other interactions between the Parties in connection with this Agreement, neither Party shall be obligated to enter into any further agreement, transaction, or business relationship of any kind. The execution of this Agreement and any subsequent negotiations or discussions are for exploratory purposes only and do not create any binding commitment on either Party to proceed with any proposed transaction or collaboration. No rights or obligations, other than those expressly set forth herein, shall arise with respect to any prospective arrangement until a definitive agreement, duly executed by both Parties, is entered into. Each Party expressly reserves the right to terminate any discussions or negotiations at its sole discretion, without liability or further obligation to the other Party.
