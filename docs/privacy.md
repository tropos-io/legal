Your privacy is critically important to us. At Tropos, we have a few fundamental principles:

- We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
- We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
- We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
- We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
- We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

## Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow large companies — regardless of their industries — to build and scale data products. Our mission is to simplify the complexity of analyzing data.  

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

- Our websites (including tropos.io);

This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Tropos or one of our subsidiaries.

Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as "Services."  

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to our job portal, that has a separate privacy policy.

Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

## Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let's go over the information that we collect.

### Information You Provide to Us

It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

- **Basic account information**: We ask for basic information from you in order to send you marketing materials at when you ask for them. For example, we require individuals who want to receive a copy of one of our frameworks to share their name, email address , company name and phone number — and that's it. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don't require that information to send the collateral overt.

- **Business Profile**: When you enter your details, we may add you to our customer relationship database using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us.

- **Communications with us (hi there!)**: You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our sales team about a information request, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications.

- **Job applicant information**: If you apply for a job with us — awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, professional or personal references, similar professional and employment-related data, and work authorization verification as part of the application process. We may also collect additional information about you during the process, like background and credit checks (in applicable jurisdictions and only for certain job roles). You may also provide us with demographic information when required by law or to support our diverse workplace initiatives, such as your gender, racial or ethnic origin, and disability status if you voluntarily submit such information as part of your application. We collect demographic information in accordance with applicable law, and do not request demographic information in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited. We will only use this sensitive information to accommodate a disability or illness, comply with legal obligations, protect the health and safety of our employees, and facilitate our internal programs relating to diversity, inclusion, and anti-discrimination.

### Information We Collect Automatically

We also collect some information automatically:

- **Log information**: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.

- **Location information**: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system's permissions.

- **Stored information**: We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system's permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device's camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.

- **Information from cookies & other technologies**: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Tropos uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

### Information We Collect from Other Sources

Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our customers (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like email reachouts, directed advertising and other mailers advertising our Services.

## How and Why We Use Information

### Purposes for Using Information

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

- To provide our Services. For example, to set up a working relationship and talk with you about our services.
- To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services. For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
- To place and manage ads in our advertising program. For example, to place ads on our users' sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.
- To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.
