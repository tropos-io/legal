# 1\. Purpose, Scope, and Roles
-----------------------------

**1.1 Purpose.** This Annex D (“Data Processing Addendum” or “Addendum”) sets forth the terms and conditions under which the Supplier will Process Personal Data on behalf of the Client in connection with the services provided under the Master Services Agreement (“MSA”). The purpose of this Addendum is to ensure such Processing is conducted in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and to establish the respective obligations of the Client and the Supplier in relation to Personal Data protection.

**1.2 Scope and Application.** This Addendum applies to all Processing of Personal Data by the Supplier as a Data Processor on behalf of the Client as Data Controller under the MSA. In particular, it covers all Personal Data processed in the course of providing services under Annex B (Professional Services) and Annex F (Managed Services) of the MSA, as well as any other services under the MSA that involve the Processing of Personal Data. This Addendum governs the handling of Personal Data for the full duration of such services and any Personal Data retained or processed in connection with those services.

**1.3 Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that, for the purposes of Applicable Data Protection Law: (a) the Client acts as the Data Controller (determining the purposes and means of the Processing of Personal Data); and (b) the Supplier acts as the Data Processor (Processing Personal Data on behalf of the Client). Each Party shall fulfill the obligations applicable to its role as Controller or Processor under Applicable Data Protection Law. Neither Party shall do anything that would cause the other to breach its respective obligations under such laws.

**1.4 Incorporation into MSA; Precedence.** This Addendum is incorporated by reference into and forms part of the MSA. Unless otherwise expressly provided, all capitalized terms in this Addendum shall have the meanings given to them in Annex A (Definitions) of the MSA or in Applicable Data Protection Law. In the event of any conflict between this Addendum and the MSA or any Statement of Work (“SOW”) regarding the Processing of Personal Data, the terms of this Addendum shall prevail with respect to such Processing. All other provisions of the MSA remain in full force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, any stricter or additional obligations in this Addendum with respect to data protection shall control over more general terms in the MSA.

# 2\. Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of this Addendum, and in addition to the definitions provided in the MSA and Annex A thereto, the following terms have the meanings set out below. Terms used but not defined in this Addendum (e.g. _personal data_, _processing_, _controller_, _processor_, _data subject_) shall have the meanings given to them in Article 4 of the GDPR or other Applicable Data Protection Law:

*   **“Applicable Data Protection Law”** means all worldwide data protection and privacy laws and regulations applicable to the Processing of Personal Data under the MSA, including, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and any applicable national implementing or supplemental laws, the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and UK GDPR (if relevant), and any other laws governing the privacy or Processing of Personal Data.
    
*   **“Personal Data”** means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”) that is processed by the Supplier on behalf of the Client under the MSA. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, contact details, identification number, online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person. For the purposes of this Addendum, Personal Data includes **Client Personal Data**, meaning all Personal Data provided by or on behalf of the Client and processed by the Supplier for the performance of the Services.
    
*   **“Processing”** (and its corollaries _Process_, _Processed_, etc.) means any operation or set of operations performed on Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collecting, recording, organizing, structuring, storing, adapting or altering, retrieving, consulting, using, disclosing by transmission, disseminating or otherwise making available, aligning or combining, restricting, erasing, or destroying such data.
    
*   **“Controller”** means the natural or legal person which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the Processing of Personal Data. For purposes of this Addendum, the Client is the Controller of Client Personal Data.
    
*   **“Processor”** means a natural or legal person which processes Personal Data on behalf of the Controller. For purposes of this Addendum, the Supplier is the Processor of Client Personal Data.
    
*   **“Subprocessor”** means any third-party (including any Supplier Affiliate, but excluding employees of the Supplier) engaged by the Supplier to Process Personal Data on behalf of the Client in order to provide the services under the MSA. Subprocessors may include cloud hosting providers, subcontractors, and other service providers that have access to or otherwise Process Personal Data.
    
*   **“Standard Contractual Clauses” or “SCCs”** means the standard data protection contract clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to the GDPR, as may be amended or replaced from time to time (for example, the SCCs set out in the Commission’s Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021).
    
*   **“Personal Data Breach”** means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed. This definition mirrors the definition of “personal data breach” in the GDPR and covers any security incident that has or may have a detrimental effect on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Personal Data.
    

_(Any other capitalized terms used in this Addendum that are not defined above or in GDPR shall have the meaning given to them in the MSA.)_

# 3\. Details of Processing
-------------------------

This Clause 3 describes the subject matter and details of the Processing of Personal Data that the Supplier will carry out on behalf of the Client under the MSA, as required by Article 28(3) of the GDPR.

**3.1 Subject Matter and Duration of Processing.** The subject matter of the Processing is the performance of the Supplier’s services as described in the MSA (including Annex B – Professional Services and Annex F – Managed Services) and any applicable SOW, which necessitate the Processing of Personal Data on behalf of the Client. The duration of the Processing shall be for the term of the MSA and for any additional period after the termination of the MSA during which the Supplier is required to continue storing or Processing Personal Data for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under the MSA or complying with Applicable Data Protection Law (e.g. retention requirements), until such data is returned or deleted in accordance with this Addendum.

**3.2 Nature and Purpose of Processing.** The nature of the Processing includes all operations necessary to provide the services and carry out the Supplier’s obligations under the MSA and any SOW, which may include (without limitation) collecting, recording, organizing, storing, retrieving, analyzing, using, transmitting, and deleting Personal Data. The purpose of the Processing is strictly limited to delivering the agreed services to the Client and performing the Client’s documented instructions. Such purposes may include, for example: implementing and configuring software or systems with personal user data (in the case of Professional Services), operating and managing systems or applications that contain Personal Data (in the case of Managed Services), troubleshooting and support, data backup, or other activities as specified in the MSA or relevant SOW. The Supplier shall not Process the Personal Data for any purpose other than as specified in the MSA, this Addendum, or as otherwise documented in instructions from the Client.

**3.3 Categories of Data Subjects.** The Personal Data to be Processed under this Addendum pertains to the following categories of Data Subjects (as relevant to the services provided and as determined by the Client):

*   **Client Employees and Contractors:** Employees, officers, representatives, agents, or contractors of the Client (e.g. in cases where the Supplier is granted access to HR data, IT user accounts, or similar information as part of providing services).
    
*   **Client Customers and End-Users:** Individuals who are customers, clients, end-users, or other individuals doing business with or serviced by the Client, whose Personal Data is provided to the Supplier in connection with the services (for example, if the Supplier is processing a client’s customer database, website user data, or support tickets containing personal information).
    
*   **Other Data Subjects as Specified:** Any other category of Data Subjects explicitly identified in a relevant SOW or agreed in writing by the Parties as necessary for the provision of the services. (The Client shall ensure that any such additional categories are communicated to the Supplier before Processing.)
    

**3.4 Types of Personal Data.** The types of Personal Data that will be Processed by the Supplier on behalf of the Client may include, but are not limited to, the following (depending on the nature of services and as specified in relevant SOWs):

*   **Identification and Contact Data:** e.g. full name, email address, telephone number, postal address, user ID, login credentials, or other contact information.
    
*   **Professional or Employment Data:** e.g. job title, department, employer, work contact details, organizational role, or other work-related information (particularly for Client’s employees or contractors).
    
*   **IT System Usage Data:** e.g. system identifiers, login timestamps, IP addresses, device identifiers, or other data collected through system logs and usage monitoring when the Supplier provides IT services or managed services.
    
*   **Customer Relationship Data:** e.g. account details, order history, support inquiries, feedback or correspondence that include personal identifiers of the Client’s customers or end-users.
    
*   **Any Other Personal Data Provided:** Any other personal information that the Client provides to the Supplier for Processing as part of the services, as described in an applicable SOW or written instruction.
    

The Personal Data **excludes** any special categories of data or sensitive Personal Data (such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, data concerning health or sex life, or data relating to criminal convictions/offenses), **unless** explicitly agreed in an SOW and subject to any additional safeguards required by Applicable Data Protection Law. The Client agrees that it will not knowingly provide, and shall refrain from causing the Supplier to Process, any such special categories of Personal Data unless necessary and lawful. If any special category data is required to be processed, the Parties shall first document the specific categories and implement appropriate additional measures as needed to protect that data.

**3.5 Location of Processing.** The Processing of Personal Data will be carried out primarily at the Supplier’s operating locations and those of its Subprocessors. The Supplier’s primary processing facilities are located in the jurisdictions specified in the SOWs or as otherwise notified to the Client. The Supplier shall not transfer Personal Data to locations outside the jurisdictions permitted under Clause 8 (International Data Transfers) without complying with the requirements set forth in that clause.

**3.6 Documentation of Processing Details.** The information provided in this Clause 3 is intended to fulfill the requirement of a description of Processing details as mandated by Article 28 of the GDPR. The Parties may further detail or update these descriptions in specific SOWs or an Appendix to this Addendum as needed to reflect the actual Processing activities. Neither Party shall Process or permit the Processing of Personal Data in a manner that is not consistent with this described scope without the prior written agreement of the other Party.

# 4\. Legal Basis and Instructions
--------------------------------

**4.1 Lawful Basis of Processing (Client’s Responsibility).** The Client is responsible for determining and establishing the legal basis for the Processing of Personal Data under the MSA. The Client warrants that (a) it has obtained and shall maintain all necessary rights, consents, and legal grounds required under Applicable Data Protection Law to permit the Supplier to Process the Personal Data for the purposes set out in the MSA and this Addendum, and (b) the Supplier’s Processing of the Personal Data in accordance with the Client’s instructions will not cause the Supplier to violate any Applicable Data Protection Law. The Client shall not instruct the Supplier to process any Personal Data in a manner that would violate any data protection laws or regulations.

**4.2 Documented Instructions.** The Supplier shall Process Personal Data **only** on documented instructions from the Client, unless otherwise required by Applicable Data Protection Law. The MSA (including this Addendum and any relevant SOWs) constitutes the Client’s initial complete instructions to the Supplier for the Processing of Personal Data. Any additional or alternate instructions must be agreed in writing (including via email or ticketing system acknowledged by both Parties as valid instructions). The Supplier shall not Process the Personal Data for any purpose or in any manner except on the Client’s instructions and as necessary to perform the agreed services. In particular, the Supplier will not **sell** or **use** the Client’s Personal Data for the Supplier’s own purposes, including for marketing or data analytics unrelated to the Client’s instructions.

**4.3 Instructions Prevailing; Prohibited Data.** The Client’s documented instructions shall at all times comply with Applicable Data Protection Law. The Supplier will promptly inform the Client if, in the Supplier’s opinion, an instruction provided by the Client infringes the GDPR or other Applicable Data Protection Law. In such event, the Supplier may suspend the execution of the questionable instruction until the Parties have agreed upon a lawful manner to proceed. The Client shall not require the Supplier to Process any Personal Data that is not necessary for the provision of services or that would violate data minimization principles; similarly, the Supplier shall promptly alert the Client if it becomes aware that the Client is asking it to process excessive or irrelevant Personal Data.

**4.4 Lawful Processing without Instructions.** If the Supplier is ever required by European Union or EU Member State law (or other applicable law) to Process Personal Data in a manner that is contrary to or outside the scope of the Client’s instructions (for example, if required by a valid court order or governmental mandate), the Supplier shall notify the Client of that legal requirement **before** processing (unless the law prohibits such notice on important grounds of public interest). In such case, the Supplier will cooperate with the Client to limit the scope of Processing to what is legally required and ensure that any such Processing is done in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law.

**4.5 Client Instructions and Configuration.** The Client is responsible for ensuring that its use of the Supplier’s services (including any configuration of features or processing options within a software or platform provided by Supplier) is in line with the Client’s obligations under data protection law. To the extent the Supplier’s services allow the Client to control aspects of the Processing (e.g. configuring retention periods, data fields collected, or access controls), the Client shall be responsible for using such features in a manner consistent with law and this Addendum. The Supplier will follow any configuration or Processing choices made by the Client through the use of the services, which shall be considered “instructions” of the Client for purposes of this Addendum.

# 5\. Supplier’s Obligations as Processor
---------------------------------------

**5.1 Compliance with Applicable Law.** The Supplier shall comply with all Applicable Data Protection Law in Processing Personal Data on behalf of the Client and shall handle Personal Data only in a manner that would not cause either Party to be in breach of its respective obligations under such laws. The Supplier shall promptly inform the Client if it cannot comply with any obligation under this Addendum or if it believes any instruction from the Client violates Applicable Data Protection Law, so that the Parties can resolve the issue. The Supplier will maintain a record of all categories of Processing activities carried out on behalf of the Client, as required by GDPR Article 30(2), and shall make such records available to the Client or to a Supervisory Authority upon request as evidence of the Supplier’s compliance.

**5.2 Personnel Authorization and Confidentiality.** The Supplier shall ensure that all personnel, employees, agents, or contractors who are authorized to Process Personal Data under this Addendum (i) are properly trained on their data protection and confidentiality obligations, (ii) are subject to a binding contractual or statutory **duty of confidentiality** with respect to Personal Data (for example, through individual confidentiality agreements or appropriate clauses in employment contracts), and (iii) only Process Personal Data as needed for the performance of their duties to fulfill the Supplier’s obligations under the MSA. The Supplier shall restrict access to Personal Data strictly to those personnel who require such access to perform the services (the “need-to-know” principle). The Supplier will regularly review and update access rights to ensure that only current authorized individuals have access to the Personal Data. If any personnel no longer require access, the Supplier will promptly revoke their access credentials. The obligations of confidentiality in this clause shall survive termination of the MSA and this Addendum.

**5.3 Reliability and Limitation of Staff Access.** The Supplier shall take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability and integrity of any personnel who have access to Personal Data, including performing background checks to the extent permitted by law and commensurate with the employee’s role. The Supplier will ensure that personnel Processing Personal Data are aware of the sensitive nature of the data and the importance of maintaining its security and confidentiality. If the Client so requests, the Supplier will, to the extent practicable, designate specific staff or teams to handle the Client’s Personal Data, and will provide the names or roles of key contacts on the Supplier’s team who are responsible for overseeing compliance with this Addendum.

**5.4 Assistance with Compliance and Data Protection Impact Assessments.** Taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to the Supplier, the Supplier shall assist the Client in ensuring compliance with the Client’s obligations under Applicable Data Protection Law. This includes, upon request, providing reasonable assistance to the Client with:

*   **(a) Data Protection Impact Assessments:** If the Client is required under GDPR Article 35 (or equivalent provisions) to carry out a data protection impact assessment (“DPIA”) for a Processing activity that involves the Supplier, the Supplier shall provide relevant information and support to the Client to facilitate the DPIA, including information about the Supplier’s Processing operations and security measures.
    
*   **(b) Prior Consultation:** If the Client deems it necessary to consult with a Supervisory Authority before Processing pursuant to GDPR Article 36 (e.g. where a DPIA indicates high residual risk), the Supplier shall assist in providing any information about the Processing that the Supervisory Authority may require.
    
*   **(c) Information and Cooperation:** The Supplier will provide the Client, upon reasonable notice, with such information in the Supplier’s possession or control as the Client may reasonably request to demonstrate the Supplier’s compliance with this Addendum or to respond to any inquiry or investigation by a Supervisory Authority. This includes cooperation in responding to any data protection impact queries, providing details of Subprocessors, system architectures, data flows, and security practices relevant to the Processing.
    

**5.5 Cooperation with Supervisory Authorities.** The Supplier shall cooperate with and assist the Client in responding to or addressing any inquiry, investigation, complaint, or request from a competent data protection **Supervisory Authority** that relates to Personal Data processed under this Addendum. If a Supervisory Authority makes a demand directly from the Supplier (such as an audit, inspection, or access request), the Supplier shall, unless legally prohibited, inform the Client without undue delay and shall cooperate with the Client in complying with or responding to such request. The Supplier shall not volunteer information to a Supervisory Authority in relation to the Client’s Personal Data without consulting the Client first, unless required by law to do so.

**5.6 Prohibition on Combining Personal Data.** The Supplier shall not combine or merge Personal Data received from the Client with personal data from any other source (except as necessary to carry out the Client’s instructions or as expressly permitted by the Client). In particular, the Supplier shall not “profile” or analyze the Client’s Personal Data in conjunction with personal data of other customers of the Supplier, nor use it for building data models or analytics that are not for the sole benefit of the Client, unless explicitly authorized by the Client and compliant with Applicable Data Protection Law.

**5.7 No Use of Data for Marketing or Advertising.** The Supplier shall never use Personal Data obtained in the course of providing services to send direct marketing to Data Subjects, to build advertising profiles, or for any purpose other than providing the services to the Client. The Supplier acknowledges that it has no rights in or to the Personal Data and will not assert any lien or retention right over the Personal Data. All Personal Data shall be considered the Confidential Information of the Client.

**5.8 Prompt Remediation.** In the event the Supplier becomes aware of any non-compliance with its obligations under this Addendum or Applicable Data Protection Law (including any unauthorized Processing or security incident, addressed further in Clause 6), the Supplier will promptly take steps to remediate the issue and mitigate any risks or damages. The Supplier will inform the Client of the nature of the non-compliance and the remedial actions taken or proposed.

_(The obligations set out in this Clause 5 are in addition to any other obligations of confidentiality and compliance specified in the MSA. Nothing in this Addendum reduces the Supplier’s obligations under the GDPR or other Applicable Data Protection Law.)_

# 6\. Data Security and Breach Notification
-----------------------------------------

**6.1 Security Measures.** The Supplier shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data. These measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including (as appropriate) measures to: (a) pseudonymize and encrypt Personal Data; (b) ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services; (c) restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and (d) regularly test, assess, and evaluate the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of Processing. The Supplier’s security measures are designed to protect Personal Data from all anticipated threats or hazards, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature of the data, and the harm that might result from a security incident. At a minimum, the Supplier’s information security program shall include access controls, encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest (where feasible), network and system monitoring, regular security training for personnel, and incident response plans. The Supplier shall periodically review and update its security measures to adapt to new risks or guidance from data protection authorities.

**6.2 Compliance with Security Standards.** If the Client has specified any particular security standards or policies in an Annex or SOW (for example, requiring compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 standards, industry-specific regulations, or the Client’s internal security policies provided to the Supplier), the Supplier shall implement such specified measures or standards, or at minimum, measures that meet the same level of protection. In the event of any conflict between the security requirements of this Addendum and those specified in any separate security annex or policy incorporated into the MSA, the stricter standard or higher level of protection shall apply. The Supplier shall upon request provide the Client with up-to-date attestations, certifications, or summaries of audit reports (e.g. ISO 27001 certificate, SOC 2 Type II report, or similar) that evidence the implementation of appropriate security measures.

**6.3 Personal Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed or suspected Personal Data Breach affecting Client Personal Data, the Supplier shall notify the Client **without undue delay** after becoming aware of the breach. Such notification should, to the extent reasonably possible, be made _within 24-48 hours_ of the Supplier’s discovery of the Personal Data Breach. The notification to the Client shall include, to the extent available at the time of notice, the following information:

*   **The nature of the Personal Data Breach**, including, where possible, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects concerned, and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned.
    
*   **The likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach**, including any observed or reasonably anticipated harm to Data Subjects.
    
*   **Measures taken or proposed to address the Personal Data Breach**, including, where appropriate, measures to contain the breach and mitigate its possible adverse effects.
    

If all of the above details are not available at the time of initial notification, the Supplier shall provide the information in phases as it becomes available, without undue further delay. The Supplier will promptly investigate the Personal Data Breach and take all necessary steps to mitigate the effects and minimize any damage resulting from the Breach. The Supplier shall keep the Client informed of the status of the investigation and any findings.

**6.4 Breach Response and Cooperation.** Following a Personal Data Breach, the Supplier will cooperate with the Client’s reasonable requests in connection with the Client’s breach notification obligations. This includes assisting the Client in communicating with affected Data Subjects or relevant Supervisory Authorities, if required by law. The Supplier shall document all facts relating to the Personal Data Breach, its effects, and the remedial actions taken, and shall provide such documentation to the Client upon request. The Supplier will not communicate with any third party (including the media, Data Subjects, or Supervisory Authorities) about any Personal Data Breach except as instructed by the Client, or as required by applicable law (in which case the Supplier will to the extent permitted inform the Client of that requirement beforehand). All notifications under this clause shall be made to the Client’s designated incident response contact (as identified by the Client, e.g. to a specific email address or phone number designated for data breach notices).

**6.5 Ongoing Security Obligations.** The Supplier acknowledges that its obligations under this Clause 6 (Data Security and Breach Notification) are continuous and remain in effect for as long as the Supplier Processes Personal Data on behalf of the Client, including during any period of suspension of services, and until deletion of all Personal Data as per Clause 11. The Supplier shall adapt its security measures in light of any changes to industry standards or legal requirements, and in response to any significant changes in the nature of the Processing or the risks presented. Upon the Client’s reasonable request, the Supplier will provide more detailed information about its security controls and facilitate any required security assessments or audits as described in Clause 10 (Audit Rights).

# 7\. Subprocessors
-----------------

**7.1 Use of Subprocessors – General Authorization.** The Client grants the Supplier a general authorization to engage **Subprocessors** (third-party data processors) to assist in the Processing of Personal Data for the purposes of fulfilling the Supplier’s obligations under the MSA, **provided that** the Supplier meets the requirements set forth in this Clause 7. A list of the Supplier’s current Subprocessors (including their names and purposes of Processing) shall be made available to the Client either in an Appendix to this Addendum, via a Supplier website or portal, or upon the Client’s request. The Supplier shall ensure that any Subprocessor it engages to process Personal Data on the Client’s behalf is bound by a written agreement that imposes on the Subprocessor data protection obligations that are at least as protective as those imposed on the Supplier under this Addendum (including requirements to only process Personal Data on the Supplier’s instructions, to implement appropriate security measures, to respect data subject rights, and to otherwise comply with Applicable Data Protection Law). The Supplier shall remain fully liable to the Client for the performance of any Subprocessor’s obligations **and** for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause the Supplier to breach any of its obligations under this Addendum. In other words, the Supplier’s use of a Subprocessor shall not relieve the Supplier of any responsibility or liability under this Addendum or the MSA. The Supplier will regularly conduct due diligence on its Subprocessors to ensure they provide sufficient guarantees of their ability to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law.

**7.2 Notification and Objection to New Subprocessors.** The Supplier shall provide the Client with reasonable prior notice (for example, at least 30 days’ notice, where feasible) of any **intended addition or replacement** of Subprocessors. The Supplier may fulfill this obligation by emailing the Client’s designated contact or by other written notification, and by updating the Subprocessor list provided to the Client. If the Client has a reasonable objection to the engagement of a new Subprocessor based on legitimate data protection grounds (e.g. if the Client can demonstrate that the new Subprocessor cannot provide an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data or would put the Client in violation of Applicable Data Protection Law), then the Client shall notify the Supplier of such objections in writing within the notice period. The Parties will then discuss the concern in good faith with a view to finding a mutually acceptable resolution. This may include the Supplier recommending a commercially reasonable change to the service or configuration to avoid Processing by the objected Subprocessor, or taking additional steps to ensure the Subprocessor’s compliance. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Client’s objections to a new Subprocessor, the Client shall have the right to terminate the relevant portion of the services that cannot be provided without the use of the objected Subprocessor. In such case, the Client will provide written notice of termination within a reasonable time, and the termination will be without penalty (any prepaid fees for the terminated portion of services would be refunded pro rata). The Supplier shall not engage the new Subprocessor to Process the Client’s Personal Data until the applicable notice period has lapsed and the Client has not raised any timely objection, or the Parties have resolved any objection.

**7.3 Subprocessor Agreements and Key Terms.** The Supplier’s agreement with each Subprocessor shall, to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by the Subprocessor: (a) require the Subprocessor to only Process Personal Data on the Supplier’s instructions (which should mirror the Client’s instructions to the Supplier); (b) impose data protection and security requirements no less stringent than those set out in this Addendum (in particular, providing the same level of protection for Personal Data as required by GDPR Article 28(3)); (c) include terms that provide the Client (via the Supplier) the same rights to audit and inspect the Subprocessor’s activities as the Client has towards the Supplier under Clause 10 (Audit Rights), or alternatively ensure that the Subprocessor has appropriate certifications or audit reports that can be shared; (d) require the Subprocessor to promptly inform the Supplier of any Personal Data Breach so that the Supplier can comply with its obligations to notify the Client; and (e) terminate automatically upon termination of the Supplier’s provision of the relevant services to the Client, such that the Subprocessor will not retain the Personal Data except as permitted by Clause 11 (Return and Deletion). The Supplier shall, upon request, provide the Client with an overview of the data protection terms of its Subprocessor agreements or excerpts necessary to demonstrate compliance with this clause (the Supplier may redact commercial information not relevant to data protection compliance).

**7.4 Emergency Replacement of Subprocessor.** The Client acknowledges that in certain rare circumstances (such as an emergency or sudden inability of an existing Subprocessor to perform), the Supplier may need to replace or add a Subprocessor on shorter notice to ensure continuity of the services. In such cases, the Supplier will inform the Client as soon as possible of the change and the reasons for it, and the Client retains the right to object to the continued use of that replacement Subprocessor as per Clause 7.2 after the fact. The Supplier will work with the Client in good faith to minimize any risks to Personal Data in such emergency substitution scenarios.

**7.5 Subprocessors for International Transfers.** If the Supplier engages a Subprocessor in a country outside the EEA (or other approved territories), such engagement shall be considered a restricted transfer and the Supplier will ensure that lawful transfer mechanisms are in place in compliance with Clause 8 (International Data Transfers) below (for example, by executing SCCs with the Subprocessor, or relying on the Subprocessor’s binding corporate rules or other approved mechanism). The Supplier will inform the Client of which safeguard is used for any non-EEA Subprocessor upon request.

# 8\. International Data Transfers
--------------------------------

**8.1 Restrictions on Cross-Border Data Transfers.** The Supplier shall not _transfer_ or _access_ any of the Client’s Personal Data from a country outside of the jurisdiction(s) agreed by the Parties or permitted by Applicable Data Protection Law, unless such transfer is made in compliance with the requirements of this Clause 8. For the purposes of this Addendum, a “transfer” of Personal Data includes any access by or disclosure to a party located in a country outside of: (i) the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and any country, territory, sector or organization officially recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection; and (ii) if applicable, the United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively with the EEA, the “Approved Jurisdictions”). The Client acknowledges that the Supplier and/or its Subprocessors may, in the course of providing the services, process or access Personal Data from locations outside the Approved Jurisdictions (for example, if the Supplier’s support team is located in a non-EEA country, or if cloud infrastructure is globally distributed). In all such cases, the Supplier shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with GDPR Chapter V and other Applicable Data Protection Law governing international data transfers.

**8.2 Approved Transfer Mechanisms.** For any transfer of Personal Data from an Approved Jurisdiction to a country that has not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the relevant authority (e.g. the European Commission or UK Secretary of State, as applicable), the Parties agree to implement appropriate safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection. Such safeguards may include, without limitation:

*   Relying on a valid **adequacy decision** (if the destination country or recipient is covered by an adequacy determination by the European Commission or relevant authority, Personal Data may be transferred on that basis);
    
*   Entering into the relevant **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** as adopted or approved under Applicable Data Protection Law, which shall be deemed incorporated into this Addendum by reference as necessary to legally effectuate transfers. In particular, the EU SCCs (Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, Module Two for controller-to-processor transfers) are hereby **incorporated by reference** and shall apply to any Processing of Personal Data by the Supplier (as “data importer”) outside the EEA in a country not covered by an adequacy decision, with the Client as “data exporter.” For purposes of the SCCs: (i) the Module Two (Controller to Processor) terms shall apply; (ii) in Clause 7 of the SCCs, the optional docking clause shall not apply unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise; (iii) in Clause 9 of the SCCs (Use of Subprocessors), Option 2 (general written authorization) applies and the “time period” for prior notice of new subprocessors shall be as set forth in Clause 7.2 of this Addendum; (iv) in Clause 11, the optional language allowing audits by data subjects shall not apply; (v) in Clause 17 (Governing law), the Parties select the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established (or if the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, the law of Belgium); (vi) in Clause 18 (Choice of forum), the Parties select the courts of the same EU Member State as determined for Clause 17; (vii) Annex I of the SCCs (List of Parties, Description of Transfer) shall be deemed completed with the details set out in Clause 3 of this Addendum; and (viii) Annex II of the SCCs (Technical and Organizational Measures) shall be deemed completed with the measures described in Clause 6 of this Addendum. The Parties agree that if and to the extent the SCCs are superseded, replaced or invalidated by competent authority, they will work together in good faith to promptly implement an alternative valid transfer mechanism.
    
*   Implementing any additional **supplementary measures** that may be necessary to ensure that Personal Data transferred under the SCCs or other mechanism is afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA. Such measures may include technical measures (like encryption in transit and at rest, pseudonymization such that data cannot be attributed to an individual without additional information held separately in the EEA, etc.), organizational measures (such as policies and staff training regarding government access requests), or contractual measures with the recipient (such as transparency requirements or commitments to challenge unlawful orders). The Supplier shall, upon the Client’s request, provide information about the supplementary measures it has in place for international transfers.
    

In addition to or instead of the SCCs, the Parties may agree in writing to use **Binding Corporate Rules**, an **approved Code of Conduct or Certification** together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient, or any other transfer mechanism approved under GDPR Article 46. If the Supplier adopts Binding Corporate Rules for Processors, or if an applicable Subprocessor has Binding Corporate Rules approved, those may be used to cover relevant transfers of Personal Data.

**8.3 Government Data Access Requests.** The Supplier shall put in place reasonable technical, organizational and legal measures to protect Personal Data transferred pursuant to this Clause 8 from any unlawful or unauthorized access by public authorities. If the Supplier or any Subprocessor receives a legally binding request from a public authority (including judicial authorities) for disclosure of Personal Data transferred under this Addendum, the Supplier shall (a) unless prohibited by law, promptly notify the Client of the request before disclosing any Personal Data, so that the Client can seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; (b) attempt to redirect the authority to request the data directly from the Client (the data controller); and (c) only disclose the minimum amount of data necessary to comply with the request, in accordance with applicable law. The Supplier shall maintain a record of any such disclosures and make it available to the Client upon request.

**8.4 Precedence of Transfer Terms.** In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of the SCCs (where they apply) and any provision of the MSA or this Addendum, the provision of the SCCs shall prevail to the extent of the transfer of Personal Data that is subject to the SCCs. The Parties’ intention is to uphold the legality of cross-border data transfers and to comply with all applicable restrictions; therefore, this Clause 8 shall be interpreted to allow transfers only in compliance with law. If at any time a transfer of Personal Data under this Addendum cannot be conducted in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law, the Client may instruct the Supplier to cease the relevant transfer until such compliance is ensured (without prejudice to any other rights such as termination as needed).

# 9\. Data Subject Rights and Requests
------------------------------------

**9.1 Data Subject Requests Received by Supplier.** The Supplier shall promptly (and in any event within **five (5) business days**) notify the Client if the Supplier receives any request directly from a Data Subject whose Personal Data is being Processed under this Addendum, wherein the Data Subject seeks to exercise any of their rights under Applicable Data Protection Law. Such rights may include, but are not limited to: the right of access (to obtain a copy of their data), rectification (to correct inaccurate data), erasure (the “right to be forgotten”), restriction of Processing, data portability, objection to Processing (e.g. for direct marketing purposes or on grounds relating to their particular situation), or the right not to be subject to automated individual decision-making (including profiling) that produces legal or similarly significant effects on them. The Supplier shall not respond to any such Data Subject request directly **except** to acknowledge receipt or as expressly instructed by the Client in writing. The Supplier will provide the Client with reasonable cooperation and information in relation to a Data Subject’s request to enable the Client to respond to the request in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law. If the Supplier is required by law to respond directly to a Data Subject’s request (for example, if a law enforcement authority has mandated the disclosure of certain data to the Data Subject), the Supplier shall notify the Client of that requirement beforehand (unless legally prohibited) and shall limit its response to what is strictly required by law.

**9.2 Assistance with Data Subject Rights.** Taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to the Supplier, the Supplier shall assist the Client in fulfilling the Client’s obligations to respond to Data Subject requests for exercising their rights under Applicable Data Protection Law. This assistance shall include: (a) providing the Client with the ability to correct, delete, or retrieve Personal Data via the services (if such functionality exists in the software or platform managed by the Supplier); (b) upon the Client’s request, providing additional information or data in the Supplier’s possession that is necessary for the Client to fully respond to the Data Subject (for example, log data to confirm if Personal Data has been deleted, or details of data locations for a portability request); and (c) implementing or allowing the Client to implement any reasonable technical measures to enable the exercise of rights (for instance, suppression of a Data Subject’s data from future processing if they object). If a Data Subject’s request is made through the Client but requires action by the Supplier (for example, erasure of data held on the Supplier’s systems), the Supplier shall carry out the necessary action promptly upon the Client’s instruction and confirmation that the request is valid under data protection law. The Supplier shall not charge additional fees for handling routine Data Subject requests in accordance with this clause, provided that the requests are not manifestly unfounded or excessive (in which case, any handling of such requests beyond the normal scope may be chargeable at reasonable rates, if permitted by law and agreed with the Client).

**9.3 Data Subject Complaints.** In the event that a Data Subject lodges a complaint directly with the Supplier relating to the Processing of Personal Data under this Addendum, the Supplier shall promptly forward the complaint to the Client and shall not respond to the Data Subject other than to acknowledge receipt, unless instructed by the Client or required by law. The Supplier will assist and cooperate with the Client in investigating and addressing any such complaint. This may include providing the Client with information about the Processing that is relevant to the complaint, and implementing any appropriate remediation as agreed with the Client.

**9.4 Cooperation with Supervisory Authority Requests.** If a Data Subject or any person acting on a Data Subject’s behalf (such as a data protection authority or ombudsperson) contacts or inquires directly with the Supplier about the Processing of Personal Data (for example, to confirm whether the Supplier holds Personal Data about the Data Subject, or to ask about the Supplier’s data protection compliance), the Supplier shall (i) promptly inform the Client of the inquiry, providing details of the request; and (ii) defer to the Client for any response, unless the Parties agree that the Supplier should respond directly (in which case the Supplier will only respond in accordance with the Client’s approved instructions). The Supplier shall not disclose any Personal Data or any information about the Processing of Personal Data to any third party who is not the Data Subject (or their legal representative) except as mandated by a valid legal request (per Clause 8.3 or applicable law) or with the Client’s prior authorization.

**9.5 Limitations.** The Supplier’s obligation to assist with Data Subject rights shall not extend to situations where the Client has not provided the Supplier with necessary information or access to determine what Personal Data corresponds to an identified Data Subject. The Client must maintain appropriate records (for example, mapping unique identifiers in the Supplier’s system to actual individuals) so that Data Subjects can be identified within the data processed by the Supplier. The Supplier will, however, provide all information in its own records that may help identify Personal Data relating to a Data Subject, if the Client cannot identify it by itself.

**9.6 No Independent Data Subject Relationships.** The Parties acknowledge that Data Subjects have rights against each Party respectively under Applicable Data Protection Law. This Addendum does not create any third-party beneficiary rights or allow Data Subjects to directly enforce terms of this Addendum against the Supplier. However, Data Subjects may have direct rights against the Supplier under GDPR (for example, under SCCs or in cases of the Supplier’s breach of its obligations as Processor). The Supplier agrees that, in such cases, it will abide by applicable legal provisions and cooperate with the Client to the fullest extent in addressing the Data Subject’s concerns.

# 10\. Audit Rights and Transparency
----------------------------------

**10.1 Right to Audit and Inspect.** The Client (as Controller) has the right to **audit** and inspect the Supplier’s compliance with the data protection and security obligations under this Addendum and Applicable Data Protection Law. Upon the Client’s written request, the Supplier shall make available to the Client all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Addendum, and shall allow for and contribute to audits, including on-site inspections of the Supplier’s processing facilities and procedures, by the Client or an independent auditor mandated by the Client. The scope of such audits may include a review of the Supplier’s security measures, data handling practices, records, policies, Subprocessor agreements, and any other aspects relevant to the Personal Data processed on behalf of the Client. The Supplier acknowledges that the Client (or its designated auditor) may, in accordance with this clause, enter the Supplier’s premises to perform an audit of procedures relevant to the protection of Personal Data.

**10.2 Audit Procedure and Conditions.** In order to prevent disruption to the Supplier’s business and to maintain appropriate security, the Parties agree that audits and inspections shall be conducted under the following conditions:

*   The Client shall provide the Supplier with at least **thirty (30) days’** prior written notice of its intention to conduct an audit, unless a shorter notice period is necessary due to an exigent circumstance (e.g., a suspected data breach).
    
*   Any audits will be conducted during normal business hours, in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the Supplier’s day-to-day operations. The Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate the timing and scope of an audit to minimize disruption.
    
*   Audits will be limited to once in any twelve (12) month period, **unless** (i) the Client has credible evidence of a material breach of this Addendum by the Supplier, (ii) a Data Subject or Supervisory Authority has raised serious concerns about the Supplier’s data protection compliance, or (iii) such an audit is required by the order of a Supervisory Authority or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over the Client. In any of those exceptional cases, the Client may perform additional audits as reasonably required.
    
*   The Client’s audit team shall comply with the Supplier’s reasonable security, confidentiality, and health and safety policies while on-site. The Supplier reserves the right to require auditors to sign a standard confidentiality agreement as a condition of their participation in any on-site audit, to protect the Supplier’s other clients’ data and the Supplier’s proprietary information.
    
*   The Client shall be responsible for any costs it incurs in conducting an audit. If the Client hires a third-party auditor, the Client will bear the costs of the auditor. The Supplier shall bear its own expenses in supporting the audit, except that if an audit request is manifestly unfounded, unduly burdensome or excessive (for example, if the Client has already recently audited the same practices without justification for repetition), the Parties agree to discuss in good faith who should bear the costs, or whether the audit can be reasonably modified in scope.
    
*   The results of any audit (including any documents or reports produced in connection with the audit) shall be considered the Confidential Information of the Supplier, and the Client shall not disclose such results except as required by law or to its legal advisors or regulators. The Client may use the results solely for the purposes of meeting its audit requirements under Applicable Data Protection Law and confirming Supplier’s compliance with this Addendum.
    

**10.3 Supplier Certifications and Reports.** The Client acknowledges that the Supplier may already undergo regular independent audits or certifications of its information security and data protection controls, such as ISO/IEC 27001 or 27701 certification, SOC 2 Type II audits, or similar evaluations. Upon the Client’s request, the Supplier shall provide the Client with copies of relevant certifications, audit attestation letters, or summary reports (under NDA if appropriate) that can serve to demonstrate the Supplier’s compliance with this Addendum. The Client agrees that such documentation may be used to satisfy the Client’s audit requests to the extent that the provided documents adequately verify the Supplier’s compliance. For example, the Supplier may provide a recent external auditor’s report or penetration test summary in lieu of the Client conducting its own test. If the Client, acting reasonably, determines that the certifications and documentation provided by the Supplier do not provide sufficient information or assurance to meet the requirements of Article 28(3)(h) of GDPR or other Applicable Data Protection Law, the Client may request further information or an on-site audit as provided above.

**10.4 Audit Findings and Remediation.** The Supplier shall cooperate in good faith with the Client to promptly address and rectify any deficiencies identified in an audit, to the extent that such deficiencies indicate non-compliance with the obligations of this Addendum or Applicable Data Protection Law. The Parties will mutually agree upon any necessary remediation plans, including timelines for execution, and the Supplier shall implement the agreed-upon remedial actions without undue delay. If the audit reveals any material non-compliance, the Client may exercise any rights under the MSA, including possible suspension of Processing (if feasible) until the Supplier has demonstrated remediation, or as a last resort, termination of the relevant services if compliance cannot be achieved.

**10.5 Interaction with Supervisory Authorities.** Notwithstanding the Client’s audit rights above, the Client agrees that any Supervisory Authority with jurisdiction over the Client’s operations or the Processing under this Addendum may conduct an audit or inspection of the Supplier directly in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law (for example, the Supplier may be directly subject to audit by EU supervisory authorities under the SCCs or by data protection authorities under national law). The Supplier agrees to inform the Client promptly if it is subject to such an audit relating to the Processing of the Client’s Personal Data, unless legally prohibited. The Supplier shall provide the Client with the results or findings of any such regulatory audit to the extent they relate to the Supplier’s Processing of Personal Data on behalf of the Client, so that the Client is made aware of any issues and can itself fulfill any obligations to report on compliance to the authorities.

# 11\. Return and Deletion of Data
--------------------------------

**11.1 Return or Deletion upon Termination.** Upon termination or expiration of the MSA, or upon the completion of all services under the MSA that involve the Processing of Personal Data, the Supplier shall, at the **Client’s choice**, either return to the Client all Personal Data (and any copies of such data) which the Supplier processes on behalf of the Client, **or** securely destroy/delete all such Personal Data. This obligation extends to Personal Data stored on behalf of the Client by the Supplier’s Subprocessors. The Supplier shall notify the Client of its default procedure for data deletion (for instance, if the Supplier will delete data after a certain period absent contrary instructions). The Client agrees that it is responsible for expressly informing the Supplier, prior to or upon termination of the MSA, whether it elects to have the data returned or deleted. If the Client requests return of the data, the Supplier shall provide the Personal Data in a commonly used and machine-readable format (or another format reasonably requested by the Client) along with any existing metadata or other pertinent information, to ensure the data remains useful to the Client. Data return shall occur within a reasonable period following termination (for example, within 30 days), and the Supplier will confirm in writing once the data has been returned and deleted from its systems as per below. If the Client requests deletion or fails to elect an option, the Supplier will proceed to securely delete the Personal Data from its systems (except for any data required to be retained as noted in 11.2) and will certify to the Client in writing that it has done so.

**11.2 Retention Required by Law.** In the event that EU, EU Member State, or other applicable law requires the Supplier to retain some or all of the Personal Data after termination of the MSA (for instance, to comply with legal archiving obligations, accounting requirements, or in connection with litigation holds), the Supplier shall notify the Client of that legal requirement (unless such notification is prohibited by law) and may retain the data only for the period and purposes required by that law. Any Personal Data retained under this clause shall remain subject to the confidentiality and data protection obligations of this Addendum for as long as it is retained. The Supplier shall not actively Process the retained data for any purpose other than what is required by the law in question, and shall delete the data as soon as the retention period or legal requirement has lapsed. The Supplier will document the basis for retention and the data retained, and provide this information to the Client upon request.

**11.3 Interim Data Deletion.** During the term of the MSA, the Client may at any time instruct the Supplier to delete (or return) certain portions of the Personal Data if, for example, the Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purpose of Processing, or the Client is required to delete it to comply with a Data Subject’s request or a legal obligation. The Supplier shall comply with any such **reasonable request** for deletion or return as soon as practicable. If any deletion requested during the term would impair the provision of services (for example, deletion of an entire dataset necessary to perform the service), the Supplier will inform the Client of this and the Parties will discuss how to proceed (possibly scheduling deletion for earliest feasible time or deciding on partial deletion).

**11.4 Certification of Deletion.** Upon the Client’s request, the Supplier shall provide a written certification, signed by an authorized officer of the Supplier, confirming that all Personal Data for which the Client requested deletion has been deleted from the Supplier’s systems, backups, and archives in accordance with the agreed procedures, or if complete deletion is not possible (for example, data stored in encrypted backups that are impractical to segregate), the Supplier shall explain why and confirm that such data is secured and protected from any further Processing. The Client and Supplier will document any mutually agreed exceptions in which data cannot be returned or destroyed (e.g. due to technological limitations) and ensure appropriate safeguards for any such data.

**11.5 No Retention for Commercial Purposes.** The Supplier hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any retention right or to withhold any Personal Data as a means of resolving any dispute or for payment enforcement, or for any other commercial reason. Commercial disputes between the Parties shall be resolved separately, and the Supplier shall not condition the return or deletion of Personal Data on any concession or payment. This does not prevent the Supplier from enforcing any contractual rights through legal means; it simply ensures Personal Data is not held hostage.

# 12\. Liability and Indemnification
----------------------------------

**12.1 Liability Cap.** Each Party’s liability to the other Party arising out of or related to this Addendum (whether in contract, tort, or under any other theory of liability) is subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set forth in the MSA, **provided that** such limitations and exclusions are permitted by Applicable Data Protection Law. In no event shall either Party’s aggregate liability for all claims arising from or in connection with this Addendum exceed the liability cap or caps agreed in the MSA for the applicable services. The Parties intend that this Addendum and the MSA be read and construed together. If the MSA specifies a general aggregate liability cap and/or a separate cap for data protection or confidentiality breaches, those caps will apply accordingly to liabilities arising under this Addendum. Nothing in this Addendum is intended to limit or exclude liability to a greater extent than is permitted by law. In particular, no limitation or exclusion of liability set forth in the MSA shall apply to the extent that such limitation or exclusion is prohibited under Article 82 of the GDPR or other Applicable Data Protection Law (for example, a Party may not exclude liability for intentional or willful misconduct in violation of data protection laws, or for any type of liability which cannot be limited under law).

**12.2 Indemnification by Supplier.** The Supplier shall indemnify and hold harmless the Client and the Client’s Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, and employees (“Client Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed in a settlement approved by the Supplier arising out of or in connection with any third-party claim (including claims by Data Subjects or regulatory fines imposed by Supervisory Authorities) to the extent such claim **arises from**: (a) the Supplier’s breach of this Addendum or its violation of Applicable Data Protection Law in the performance of its obligations as a Processor; or (b) any Processing of Personal Data by the Supplier or its Subprocessors outside the scope of the Client’s lawful instructions (unless such Processing was required by applicable law, per Clause 4.4). This indemnity is conditional upon the Client (i) providing prompt written notice to the Supplier of any claim or threatened claim, (ii) allowing the Supplier to have sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that no settlement shall be made without the consent of the Client if the settlement imposes any liability or admission on the Client), and (iii) cooperating with the Supplier, at the Supplier’s expense, in the defense of the claim. The Supplier shall not be obligated to indemnify the Client to the extent that liability is caused by the Client’s own violation of this Addendum or Applicable Data Protection Law, or by any instructions or materials provided by the Client that are alleged to violate third-party rights.

**12.3 Indemnification by Client.** The Client shall indemnify and hold harmless the Supplier and the Supplier’s Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, and employees (“Supplier Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed in a settlement approved by the Client arising out of or in connection with any third-party claim (including claims by Data Subjects or fines by Supervisory Authorities) to the extent such claim **arises from**: (a) the Client’s breach of its obligations under this Addendum or its violation of Applicable Data Protection Law as a Controller, including without limitation any failure to obtain necessary consents or provide required notices to Data Subjects, or any processing of special categories of data without appropriate safeguards; or (b) any Processing instructions given by the Client to the Supplier that are infringing, unlawful, or that otherwise cause the Supplier to be in breach of Applicable Data Protection Law. This indemnity is conditional upon the Supplier (i) providing prompt written notice to the Client of any claim or potential claim, (ii) allowing the Client to have sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (subject to the same proviso regarding settlements as above), and (iii) cooperating with the Client, at the Client’s expense, in the defense of the claim. The Client shall not be liable to indemnify the Supplier to the extent the liability is caused by the Supplier’s breach of this Addendum or its negligence or willful misconduct.

**12.4 Apportionment of Liability to Data Subjects.** If a Data Subject (or other third party) brings a claim directly against either Party for damages related to the Processing of Personal Data that is subject to this Addendum, the Parties agree to **cooperate** in good faith in defending such claim. As between the Parties, any liability to the Data Subject shall be apportioned in accordance with each Party’s respective responsibility for the harm giving rise to the liability, as contemplated by Article 82(5) of the GDPR. In other words, if both the Client and the Supplier are found responsible for a violation of Applicable Data Protection Law, each Party shall bear responsibility for that portion of the damages attributable to its fault. If one Party (the “Paying Party”) pays more than the share of compensation corresponding to its responsibility, it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party that part of the compensation corresponding to the other Party’s responsibility for the damage.

**12.5 Liability to Data Subjects or Regulators.** The Parties acknowledge that the Client, as Controller, usually has primary responsibility toward Data Subjects for any damage caused by Processing that infringes GDPR. The Supplier, as Processor, acknowledges that under GDPR it may be directly liable to Data Subjects if it has not complied with the obligations of the GDPR specifically directed to processors, or if it acted outside of lawful instructions of the Client. Nothing in this Addendum is intended to prevent a Data Subject from seeking compensation from either Party under Article 82 GDPR. However, as between the Client and Supplier, any indemnification or reimbursement obligations shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the MSA.

**12.6 Insurance.** The Supplier shall maintain adequate insurance coverage to cover its liabilities under this Addendum, including coverage for cyber incidents or data breaches, in accordance with the insurance requirements (if any) set forth in the MSA. Upon request, the Supplier will provide evidence of such insurance to the Client. The existence of insurance coverage does not limit the Supplier’s liability or indemnification obligations under this Addendum.

**12.7 Exclusive Remedies.** Except for any equitable relief, the indemnities provided in this Clause 12 (along with any indemnities provided in the main MSA) shall constitute the exclusive remedies of each Party against the other for the types of third-party claims described herein, to the extent permissible under law. Any penalties or fines imposed by a Supervisory Authority on one Party that the other Party is responsible for reimbursing under this Addendum shall, where allowable, be treated as direct damages for the purpose of recoverability (so that they are not excluded as indirect or consequential damages under the MSA’s limitation of liability).

# 13\. Term and Survival
----------------------

**13.1 Term of Addendum.** This Data Processing Addendum shall become effective on the Effective Date of the MSA (or, if later, the date on which the Supplier first Processes Personal Data on behalf of the Client) and shall remain in effect co-terminously with the MSA for so long as the Supplier Processes any Personal Data under the MSA. Termination or expiration of the MSA shall automatically terminate this Addendum, **provided that** the Supplier has ceased all Processing of Personal Data and fulfilled all of its obligations under Clause 11 (Return and Deletion of Data). If the Supplier continues to retain or Process Personal Data after termination of the MSA (for example, if complete return or deletion of data is deferred for a brief period), then this Addendum shall remain in force with respect to such retained data until the Supplier no longer Processes or possesses any of the Client’s Personal Data.

**13.2 Survival of Obligations.** Any provision of this Addendum that is expressly or by implication intended to survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to: **Confidentiality obligations** (including those in Clause 5.2), **data return/deletion obligations** (Clause 11), **liability and indemnification** provisions (Clause 12), and this survival clause. Additionally, **security** and **data breach** obligations (Clause 6) shall survive until all Personal Data is deleted or returned, and the obligation to cooperate with investigations or audits (Clauses 9 and 10) shall survive to the extent such investigations or audits pertain to periods during which the Addendum was in effect. The Supplier’s obligations with respect to any Personal Data retained as permitted by Clause 11.2 (Retention Required by Law) shall continue until such data is deleted.

**13.3 Entire Addendum; Modification.** This Addendum and its Appendices (if any) constitute the entire understanding between the Parties with regard to data protection and privacy matters addressed herein, and supersede all prior discussions, agreements, or arrangements on those matters (if any) between the Parties. In case of ambiguity or conflict between any provision in this Addendum and any provision in any other agreement between the Parties (including the MSA or related documents), the provision that provides the most protective treatment of Personal Data and the best compliance with Applicable Data Protection Law shall control, to the extent of such ambiguity or conflict. This Addendum may only be modified by a written amendment signed by both Parties, except to the extent that amendments are required to comply with changes in law, in which case the Parties shall work together in good faith to promptly implement the necessary changes.

**13.4 Counterparts and Execution.** _\[If this Addendum is to be signed separately, include counterpart/signature language. If it is incorporated by reference into the MSA without separate signature, this clause may be omitted.\]_ This Addendum may be executed in counterparts, each of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures delivered by electronic means (such as PDF or electronic signing platforms) are deemed effective. Each person signing this Addendum represents that they have the authority to bind the Party on whose behalf they are signing.
